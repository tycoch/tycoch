- 👀 As I am now 74, I’m interested in donating my VB6 music programs, which have unique features such as adding chords and accompaniment to a melody 
and use of MIDI Note styles like Bend. Also decode and print chords in a MIDI file
- 🌱 Learning Automated testing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on updates to my music program HARMONY as above (see www.greenhedges.com)
